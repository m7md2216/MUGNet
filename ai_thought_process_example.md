## Step 1: Knowledge Graph Context Retrieval
The system calls `knowledgeGraphService.getIntelligentContext()` which:
1. Searches for entities related to "music", "preferences", "everyone"
2. Retrieves relationships from Neo4j database
3. Formats structured context data

## Step 2: Formatted Knowledge Graph Context (PRIMARY SOURCE)
This is the exact data structure sent to GPT-4o as the PRIMARY source:

## Step 3: Supplementary Conversation History
The system also provides recent conversation context showing actual messages where music was discussed.

## Step 4: Complete System Prompt Sent to GPT-4o

```
You are an AI assistant in a group chat with access to a comprehensive knowledge graph built from past conversations.

PRIMARY SOURCE - KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTELLIGENCE:
[The formatted context above]

SUPPLEMENTARY - RECENT CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
[Recent conversation history as backup context]

Instructions:
- PRIORITIZE the knowledge graph data as your primary source of truth
- Use conversation history only as supplementary context when knowledge graph is insufficient
- Be conversational and friendly
- When answering questions about people, topics, events, or relationships, rely on the structured knowledge graph data
- The knowledge graph contains entities, relationships, and connections extracted from all past conversations
- Answer questions based on entity relationships and structured knowledge rather than linear conversation scanning
- Keep responses concise but comprehensive based on the knowledge graph connections
```

## Step 5: User Message Context
```
Ryan: @AI Agent what are everyone's music preferences?
```

## Step 6: GPT-4o Processing
The LLM receives all this structured data and processes it to generate the response, prioritizing the knowledge graph relationships over conversation scanning.

## Final Response Generated
```
Hey Ryan! According to the knowledge graph, here's a summary of everyone's music preferences:

- **Ryan**: Prefers rock and metal, with a love for screaming guitars over country music or anything too twangy.

## Why This Approach Works
1. **Structured Data**: Instead of scanning 131 messages linearly, the AI receives organized relationship data
2. **Entity-Based**: Each person's preferences are mapped as specific entities with confidence scores
3. **Relationship-Aware**: The system understands connections like "dislikes country" vs "prefers rock"
4. **Context-Rich**: Includes specific details like Metallica concert attendance and Adele impressions
5. **Comprehensive**: Covers all group members' preferences in a structured format
