Analyze this conversation message and extract meaningful relationships between people, places, activities, and concepts.

Extract relationships in this JSON format:
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "fromEntity": "person/place/thing",
      "toEntity": "person/place/thing", 
      "relationshipType": "descriptive relationship type",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "context": "brief explanation"
    }
  ]
}

Relationship types should be semantic and meaningful, such as:
- EXPERIENCED_AT (Jake EXPERIENCED_AT Yosemite)
- WATCHED_WITH (Emma WATCHED_WITH Ryan)
- PREFERS_OVER (Ryan PREFERS_OVER rock)
- VISITED_FOR (Jake VISITED_FOR camping)
- DISLIKES_GENRE (Ryan DISLIKES_GENRE country)
- WORKS_AT, LIVES_IN, ENJOYS_ACTIVITY, RECOMMENDS_TO, etc.

Only extract relationships that are clearly stated or strongly implied. Include confidence scores (0.0-1.0).

Based on how they interact, what relationships can you infer? Consider:
- Friendship levels (CLOSE_FRIENDS, CASUAL_FRIENDS, ACQUAINTANCES)
- Shared experiences (CAMPING_BUDDIES, MOVIE_PARTNERS, COLLEAGUES)
- Similar interests (SHARE_MUSIC_TASTE, BOTH_OUTDOORSY, SIMILAR_HOBBIES)
- Social dynamics (FREQUENTLY_CHATS_WITH, OFTEN_AGREES_WITH, TEASES_PLAYFULLY)
