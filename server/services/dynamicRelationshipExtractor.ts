Analyze this conversation message and intelligently extract ALL meaningful relationships between people, activities, preferences, objects, and concepts.

CURRENT MESSAGE: "${message}"
SENDER: ${messageContext.sender}
RECENT CONVERSATION CONTEXT: ${messageContext.conversationHistory?.slice(-5).join(' ‚Üí ') || 'No prior context'}

CORE PRINCIPLE: Extract relationships about WHO or WHAT the message content discusses, not just the sender.

CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING:
- If the current message is responding to a previous request/statement, understand the relationship in context
- Look for humorous responses, sarcastic comments, or playful reactions
- Identify when someone is joking, being literal, or making suggestions
- Pay attention to cause-and-effect in conversation (request ‚Üí response)

RELATIONSHIP INTELLIGENCE:
- Detect preferences: "I love X", "on repeat", "favorite", "can't stand", "hate"
- Detect actions: "went to", "watched", "listened to", "ate", "bought"  
- Detect states: "is tired", "feels excited", "misses", "worried about"
- Detect comparisons: "prefers X over Y", "better than", "worse than"
- Detect ownership: "has", "owns", "got", "bought"
- Detect experiences: "encountered", "met", "saw", "heard"
- Detect habits: "always", "never", "usually", "often", "sometimes"
- Detect jokes/humor: "joked about", "made fun of", "teased about", "sarcastically said"
- Detect responses: "responded to", "replied with", "answered by saying"

INTELLIGENT RELATIONSHIP NAMING:
Instead of predefined types, CREATE descriptive relationship names that capture the exact meaning:
- "loves chocolate" ‚Üí ENJOYS_FOOD
- "has on repeat" ‚Üí LISTENS_REPEATEDLY  
- "can't stand heights" ‚Üí FEARS
- "went camping" ‚Üí EXPERIENCED_ACTIVITY
- "misses someone" ‚Üí EMOTIONALLY_ATTACHED_TO
- "prefers tea over coffee" ‚Üí PREFERS_OVER
- "always eats spicy food" ‚Üí HABITUALLY_CONSUMES
- "jokingly said she'll carry X in her bag" ‚Üí JOKED_ABOUT_CARRYING
- "humorously responded to request" ‚Üí MADE_HUMOROUS_RESPONSE

SPECIAL ATTENTION TO CONVERSATIONAL PATTERNS:
- When someone makes a request and another person responds with something impractical or funny, this is often a joke
- Look for phrases like "I'll pop one in my bag" in response to requests for large/impossible items
- Understand sarcasm and humor in context

Extract relationships in this JSON format:
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "fromEntity": "person/entity the relationship is about",
      "toEntity": "object/concept of the relationship", 
      "relationshipType": "INTELLIGENT_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "context": "brief explanation of what this relationship means, including conversational context"
    }
  ]
}

THINK CREATIVELY: What relationships would be useful for answering questions about people's preferences, experiences, and connections? Extract everything that gives insight into who people are and what they like/dislike/do. Pay special attention to humor and conversational responses.

Conversation:
${conversationContext}

Based on how they interact, what relationships can you infer? Consider:
- Friendship levels (CLOSE_FRIENDS, CASUAL_FRIENDS, ACQUAINTANCES)
- Shared experiences (CAMPING_BUDDIES, MOVIE_PARTNERS, COLLEAGUES)
- Similar interests (SHARE_MUSIC_TASTE, BOTH_OUTDOORSY, SIMILAR_HOBBIES)
- Social dynamics (FREQUENTLY_CHATS_WITH, OFTEN_AGREES_WITH, TEASES_PLAYFULLY)
