Analyze this conversation message and extract meaningful relationships between people, places, activities, and concepts.

CRITICAL: Extract relationships about the entities MENTIONED IN THE MESSAGE CONTENT, not about the message sender.

Message: "${message}"
Sender: ${messageContext.sender}
Context: ${messageContext.conversationHistory?.slice(-3).join(' | ') || 'No prior context'}

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
- Message Sender: The person who wrote/sent the message (${messageContext.sender})
- Message Subject: The people/entities that the message content is ABOUT

Extract relationships about the SUBJECTS mentioned in the message content, NOT the sender.

Examples:
- If Ali says "Jake loves rock climbing" ‚Üí Extract: Jake --[ENJOYS_ACTIVITY]--> rock climbing
- If Sarah says "Emma went to Paris" ‚Üí Extract: Emma --[VISITED]--> Paris
- If Ryan says "I like jazz music" ‚Üí Extract: Ryan --[ENJOYS_GENRE]--> jazz music

Extract relationships in this JSON format:
{
  "relationships": [
    {
      "fromEntity": "person/place/thing mentioned in content",
      "toEntity": "person/place/thing mentioned in content", 
      "relationshipType": "descriptive relationship type",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "context": "brief explanation"
    }
  ]
}

Relationship types should be semantic and meaningful, such as:
- EXPERIENCED_AT (Jake EXPERIENCED_AT Yosemite)
- WATCHED_WITH (Emma WATCHED_WITH Ryan)
- PREFERS_OVER (Ryan PREFERS_OVER rock)
- VISITED_FOR (Jake VISITED_FOR camping)
- DISLIKES_GENRE (Ryan DISLIKES_GENRE country)
- LISTENS_TO_REPEATEDLY (Emma LISTENS_TO_REPEATEDLY "Midnight Reverie")
- HAS_ON_REPEAT (Emma HAS_ON_REPEAT "song name")
- WATCHES_SHOW (group WATCHES_SHOW "TV show name")
- ENJOYS_FOOD (Emma ENJOYS_FOOD "burrito with hot sauce")
- WORKS_AT, LIVES_IN, ENJOYS_ACTIVITY, RECOMMENDS_TO, etc.

Only extract relationships that are clearly stated or strongly implied. Include confidence scores (0.0-1.0).
Focus on what the message content says ABOUT the people/entities mentioned, not about who sent the message.

Conversation:
${conversationContext}

Based on how they interact, what relationships can you infer? Consider:
- Friendship levels (CLOSE_FRIENDS, CASUAL_FRIENDS, ACQUAINTANCES)
- Shared experiences (CAMPING_BUDDIES, MOVIE_PARTNERS, COLLEAGUES)
- Similar interests (SHARE_MUSIC_TASTE, BOTH_OUTDOORSY, SIMILAR_HOBBIES)
- Social dynamics (FREQUENTLY_CHATS_WITH, OFTEN_AGREES_WITH, TEASES_PLAYFULLY)

Extract in JSON format:

  "relationships": [
    {
      "fromEntity": "Person1",
      "toEntity": "Person2",
      "relationshipType": "SPECIFIC_RELATIONSHIP_TYPE",
