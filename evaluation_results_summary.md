## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Strong Basic Fact Recall:** 77.8% accuracy on simple factual questions
2. **Excellent Preference Recognition:** 100% accuracy on user preferences
3. **Good Relationship Mapping:** Successfully tracks who said what to whom
4. **Detailed Context:** Provides rich context beyond just answering the question

### Weaknesses
1. **Emotional Tone Recognition:** 0% accuracy on emotional/feeling-based questions
2. **Specific Activity Details:** Misses nuanced specific actions (karaoke performance details)
3. **Information Gaps:** Some conversations not fully captured in knowledge graph
4. **Granularity Issues:** Sometimes provides generic answers instead of specific details

### System Behavior Analysis
- **Knowledge Graph Priority:** AI correctly prioritizes structured knowledge graph data
- **Graceful Degradation:** When information isn't available, clearly states limitations
- **Conversational Style:** Maintains friendly, helpful tone throughout responses
- **Attribution:** Properly attributes information to specific individuals

## Recommendations for Academic Paper

### Statistical Significance
- **Sample Size:** Complete all 50 questions for robust statistical analysis
- **Confidence Interval:** With 19/24 correct, 95% CI: 60.8% - 91.2%
- **Comparison Needed:** Test baseline systems (no memory, RAG, large context) for comparative analysis

### Evaluation Methodology Refinement
1. **Semantic Similarity:** Use sentence-BERT for partial credit on close answers
2. **Human Annotation:** Add human judges for subjective questions
3. **Error Analysis:** Categorize failure modes for system improvement
4. **Temporal Analysis:** Test memory degradation over time

### Key Metrics for Paper
- **Primary Metric:** Factual Accuracy Score (79.2% achieved)
- **Secondary Metrics:** Memory type breakdown, response completeness, attribution accuracy
- **Comparison Baselines:** No-memory AI, RAG systems, large context windows
- **Cost Analysis:** Knowledge graph approach vs. large context processing costs

## Next Steps
1. Complete evaluation of remaining 26 questions
2. Implement baseline comparisons
3. Add human evaluation component
4. Statistical significance testing
5. Error analysis and system improvements
